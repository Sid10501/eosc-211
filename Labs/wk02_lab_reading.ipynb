    "## Python Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a *high level programming language,* meaning it is comparatively easy for humans to read. Python programs are executed by a *python interpreter,* which takes python code, reads it into a processor (the CPU on your computer, or in our case, a Jupyterhub server) and returns a result. This process is repeated over and over for each line of code, often taking the result of one line and feeding it into the next. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is also *open source*, meaning there are no fees to download/use python, and anyone is free to add to the Python code base. This is a major reason for Python's growing popularity in the scientific community, there are many add ons (called *packages*) developed by other scientists specifically for the type of programming we want to do in this course, with more being added every day!\n",

    "### Values and Data Types \n",
    "\n",
    "| Data Type | Example | \n",
    "| --- | --- | \n",
    "| String | `'a', \"AA\",  '2', 'Mercury'` | \n",
    "| Integer | `-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 5, 10` |\n",
    "| Floating-point number | `1.0, -2.1, 3.1415` | \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strings\n",
    "Strings are a data-type that contain a sequence or 'string' of letters (although a single character such as `'s'` is still considered a string). Strings can easily be identified by eye as they are enclosed in a set of quotation marks. Strings in Python can be enclosed in single quotes (`''`), double quotes (`\"\"`), or three of each (`'''` or `\"\"\"`). Strings enclosed in triple quotes can span multiple lines. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indexing Strings\n",
    "Individual characters in a string can be accessed by their position in the string itself using ***indexing***. In Python, we start counting from zero, so the first letter is at position `0` in the string, the second letter at position `1`, the third at `2`, etc... In practice, this looks like the following example:"
